# Phase 3: Frontend React Implementation Plan

## Current Status âœ…
- **Phase 2 Complete**: Full FastAPI backend with CrewAI integration, WebSocket streaming, file processing, and comprehensive testing
- **Dependencies Consolidated**: Modern pyproject.toml setup with optional test dependencies
- **Backend API Alignment**: All endpoints needed for the UI template are implemented

## Phase 3: Frontend React Implementation

### 3.1: React Application Setup
- **Create React TypeScript Application**
  - Initialize React app with TypeScript and Vite for modern build tooling
  - Set up Tailwind CSS for styling (template uses Tailwind classes)
  - Install required dependencies: lucide-react (icons), axios/fetch (API), websocket client

### 3.2: Project Structure and Architecture
- **Create Frontend Directory Structure**
  - `frontend/src/components/` - UI components matching template structure
  - `frontend/src/services/` - API client and WebSocket client
  - `frontend/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for state management
  - `frontend/src/types/` - TypeScript types matching backend models
  - `frontend/src/utils/` - Utility functions

### 3.3: Core Component Implementation
- **Header Component**: Navigation with tabs (Decomposition, History, Templates, Reports)
- **Left Panel - Configuration**: 
  - API Keys section with show/hide toggle
  - Agent Model Configuration with provider/model dropdowns
- **Center Panel - Main Work Area**:
  - Document Upload with drag & drop functionality
  - Prompt textarea with character counter
  - Run Decomposition button with loading states
  - Results section with streaming updates

### 3.4: API Integration Layer
- **HTTP API Client**: Connect to FastAPI backend endpoints
  - File upload/processing
  - API key management (encrypted storage)
  - Agent configuration
  - Crew execution management
- **WebSocket Client**: Real-time streaming integration
  - Connection management
  - Progress updates
  - Execution status changes
  - Error handling and reconnection

### 3.5: State Management
- **React State Architecture**:
  - API keys state with validation
  - Agent configurations state
  - File upload state with progress
  - Execution state with real-time updates
  - Results state with history

### 3.6: Advanced Features
- **File Management**: Upload, preview, delete, drag & drop
- **Execution Management**: Start, monitor, cancel, download results
- **History Tab**: Past executions with results
- **Templates Tab**: Pre-built prompts and configurations
- **Reports Tab**: Analytics and execution summaries

### 3.7: Integration and Testing
- **Full Stack Integration**: Connect React frontend to FastAPI backend
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow from file upload to results
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Loading states, caching, efficient rendering

### 3.8: Production Setup
- **Build Configuration**: Production build setup with Vite
- **Deployment Preparation**: Docker containerization for frontend
- **Development Workflow**: Hot reload, proxy to backend API

## Implementation Benefits

This implementation will create a fully functional web application that:
- Matches the UI template design and functionality
- Leverages all backend capabilities built in Phase 2
- Provides real-time streaming updates during execution
- Supports multiple file formats and agent configurations
- Includes comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Enables scalable deployment and development workflow

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **API Communication**: Axios for HTTP requests, native WebSocket API
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for global state
- **Development**: Hot reload with proxy to FastAPI backend
